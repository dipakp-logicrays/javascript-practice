// Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like
	1. YES / NO
	2. ON / OFF
	3. TRUE / FALSE

// Everything With a "Value" is True
	Boolean(100);
	Boolean(3.14)
	Boolean(-15)
	Boolean("Hello")
	Boolean('false')
	Boolean(1 + 7 + 3.14)

// Everything Without a "Value" is False
	1. The Boolean value of 0 (zero) is false:
		let x = 0;
		Boolean(x);

	2. The Boolean value of -0 (minus zero) is false:

	3. The Boolean value of "" (empty string) is false:

	4. The Boolean value of undefined is false:
		let x;
		Boolean(x);

	5. The Boolean value of null is false:

	6. The Boolean value of false is (you guessed it) false:

	7. The Boolean value of NaN is false:
